  <p>
    Your account has been (somewhat) disabled because you seem to have
    fallen out of our volunteer application process. Likely this is because you
    applied to become a Ranger in a prior year but have not reapplied for this
    year.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are interested in volunteering with the Black Rock Rangers on playa this year,
    please email {{general-support-email}} and we"ll get things sorted out for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are interested in auditing a Black Rock Ranger training but don"t
    intend to become a Black Rock Ranger on playa this year, please also email
    {{general-support-email}} and let us know that.

    NOTE: You will not be able to sign up for trainings or shifts until
    we get your account sorted out.
