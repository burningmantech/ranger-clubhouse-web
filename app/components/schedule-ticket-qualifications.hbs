  <:title>{{@year}} Ticket Qualifications</:title>
  <:body>
    <p>
      To qualify for a ticket to the {{this.ticketYear}} event you need {{credits-format this.rpThreshold}} credits
      for a reduced-price ticket and {{credits-format this.scThreshold}} credits for a staff credential.
    </p>
    {{#if this.reachedSCThreshold}}
      <b class="text-success">Congratulations!</b> You're signed up for {{credits-format @credits}} credits
      worth of shifts, which is above the {{credits-format this.scThreshold}} credits required
      to qualify for a {{this.ticketYear}} free staff credential.
      {{#if this.withinSCThreshold}}
        But since you are close to the threshold, you may want to sign up for
        one more shift. (See fine print below.)
      {{/if}}
    {{else if this.almostSCThreshold}}
      <b>Almost there!</b> You're signed up for {{credits-format @credits}} credits worth of shifts, and you need
      {{credits-format this.scThreshold}} to qualify for a {{this.ticketYear}} Staff Credential ticket.
    {{else if this.reachedRPThreshold}}
      <b class="text-success">Congratulations!</b> You're signed up for {{credits-format @credits}} credits worth of
      shifts, which is above the {{credits-format this.rpThreshold}} credits required to qualify for a reduced-price
      ticket in {{this.ticketYear}}. You need only {{credits-format this.scDelta}} credits more to qualify for a
      staff credential.
      {{#if this.withinRPThreshold}}
        Since you are close to the threshold, you may want to sign up for one more shift. (See fine print below.)
      {{/if}}
    {{else if this.almostRPTicket}}
      You're signed up for {{credits-format @credits}} credits
      worth of shifts, and you need {{credits-format this.rpThreshold}} to qualify for a {{this.ticketYear}}
      reduced-price ticket.
    {{/if}}

      <div class="mt-2">
        <b>The fine print:</b> The total credits listed above are based on scheduled shift times, but ticket
        qualification credits are based on the hours you actually work. In other words, if a shift runs longer than
        the scheduled time, you'll receive more credits -- but more importantly, if a shift runs shorter than the
        scheduled time (which is typical for Burn Perimeter and Art Safety shifts), you'll receive fewer credits. If
        by the end of the event your total credits based on actual shift times are less than the required threshold,
        then you won't qualify for a (reduced-price or staff credential) ticket in {{this.ticketYear}}. If you're just
        over a threshold and depending on Burn Perimeter or Art Safety shifts to get you there, you might consider
        adding another shift or two to be on the safe side.
