    This page will let you know when your submission has been approved, and you are authorized to drive on behalf of

    Before you are allowed to drive the larger Ranger vehicles, such as trucks &amp; SUVs, on behalf of the Ranger
    department, a MVR request must be submitted and approved. Burning Man’s insurance company will run a check on your
    driving record and let us know whether you are authorized to drive on behalf of the Rangers.
    Part of submitting this form is providing consent for the insurance company to perform this check.
  </p>
  <h6 class="fw-bold">Use the following information to fill out the MVR request:</h6>
  <ul class="mb-2">
    <li>
      Select <i>Rangers</i> as the Department, otherwise we will not be notified you submitted the MVR Request.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use your Ranger callsign, {{this.person.callsign}}, as your Playa Name. Do not enter “Ranger” before your
      callsign! Otherwise, we will not be notified you submitted the MVR Request.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter <i>Wilfredo Sanchez Vega</i> as the “Manager’s Full Legal Name”.  Otherwise, we will not be notified
      whether you are authorized to drive.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure you correctly enter your driver license state and number, including any leading zeros.
    </li>
    <li>
      For “DOB” (Date of Birth) make sure you enter your birthdate NOT today’s date or the current year.
      Seriously, use your birthdate, not the current date.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Using a Personal Vehicle while on Ranger business requires specific approval. In addition to having an
    approved MVR request, all personal vehicles must be approved (or re-approved) EACH YEAR. Contact your manager
    if you believe you have an operational need to use your personal vehicle while on duty.
