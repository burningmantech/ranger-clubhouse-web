    <p>
      We strongly urge all Rangers to work at least one shift on Burn Weekend (Friday night through Sunday night) â€”
      including at least one Burn Perimeter shift. Burn Weekend is our busiest time and having solid staffing is
      critical.
    </p>
    This annoying text box will stick around until you sign up for a weekend shift.
