  Service Recognition Awards honor the year-round contributions of Cadre, Delegation, and selected Teams, as well as
  acknowledge individuals in special roles or events. These awards are purely honorary and do not count toward earning
  tickets, appreciations (such as Ranger shirts), or provisions (like meal passes). They also have no impact on Ranger
  status.

  Currently, many awards are limited to certain years and may not fully reflect all volunteer efforts. This is partly
  because many awards were auto-generated from Clubhouse records, which only cover a limited timeframe and may contain
  inaccuracies.
