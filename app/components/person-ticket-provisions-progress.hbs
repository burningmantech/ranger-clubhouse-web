        You may qualify for either a Reduced-Price Ticket (RPT) OR a Staff Credential (SC). If you do qualify for either
        ticket type,
        you will automatically qualify for a Vehicle Pass. Only one ticket type will be awarded. (i.e., if you qualify
        for a SC, you will NOT receive a RPT as well.)

        The Event Week Eat Pass allows you to eat at the commissary during the event week ONLY.
        The All-Eat Meal Pass allows you to eat at the commissary during the pre-event, event, and post-event periods.
        Both passes are good for 3 meals per day. Only one meal pass will be awarded. (i.e., if you qualify
        for an All-Eat meal pass, you will NOT receive an Event Week meal pass as well.)

    <:body>
      <p>
        The Wet Spot is the Burning Man volunteer &amp; staff shower facility located on 5:30 towards the DPW Depot.
        </p>
      <p>
        For every {{this.items.shower_pog.threshold}} hours worked during the Event Week only, you may receive a single-use
        shower pog only good for the current event.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wet Spot Access qualification allows daily access to the facility for the NEXT event. Access may be gained
        by meeting one of two thresholds:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Work {{this.items.shower_access_event_week.threshold}} hours during the EVENT WEEK. <b>- OR -</b></li>
        <li>Work {{this.items.shower_access_entire_event.threshold}} hours during the pre-event, event week and/or
          post-event period.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Only one shower access will be award. (i.e., if you met both the event week and pre-event / event week /
        post-event thresholds,
        you will receive only one shower access provision for the following event.)
