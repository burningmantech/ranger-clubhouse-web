        You may qualify for either a Reduced-Price Ticket (RPT) OR a Staff Credential (SC). If you do qualify for either
        ticket type,
        you will automatically qualify for a Vehicle Pass. Only one ticket type will be awarded. (i.e., if you qualify
        for a SC, you will NOT receive a RPT as well.)

        The Event Week Eat Pass allows you to eat at the commissary during the event week ONLY.
        The All-Eat Meal Pass allows you to eat at the commissary during the pre-event, event, and post-event periods.
        Both passes are good for 3 meals per day. Only one meal pass will be awarded. (i.e., if you qualify
        for an All-Eat meal pass, you will NOT receive an Event Week meal pass as well.)

        Both Wet Spot access and pog qualifications are based on Event Week hours only.

        The Wet Spot is the Burning Man volunteer &amp; staff shower facility located on 5:30 towards the DPW Depot. For
        every {{this.items.shower_pog.threshold}} hours worked during the event week, you may receive a single-use
        shower pog only good for the current event. The Wet Spot Access qualification allows daily access to facility
        for the NEXT event.
